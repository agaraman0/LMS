These are just examples of CRUD APIs that you might use for each app in your LMS. The specific APIs you use will depend on the needs of your project and the functionality you want to include in your LMS. Additionally, you may want to include additional APIs for more specific functionality, such as assessment submissions or course progress tracking.
